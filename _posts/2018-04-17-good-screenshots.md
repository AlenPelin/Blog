title: Good screenshots
---
A screenshot is a good source of information especially for troubleshooting issues with no doubt.
It is worth noting however that not all screenshots are same helpful.
Here is my brief list of rules that most good screenshots comply with:

* It must include entire application, not just *obviously essential* parts
* If it contains sensitive information, it must be replaced with *sample, but similar one*.
  For example, replace actual database password (e.g. Sj2937$wow) with sample (e.g. $amp1e001) which is very close to original
* It should include outlining that helps to focus on problematic part

## The Story

* The set of screenshots must represent a story line even if they are not part of any kind of story.
  This is essential because people find it so much easier to deal with a story rather than bunch of pieces whether they are connected with each other or not
* The story must not miss any important steps even if trivial
* The file names should start with ## masked sequential number followed by brief description of main step highlight
